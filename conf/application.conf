# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)

# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.username=sa
# db.default.password=""
